> This is a post I wrote in 2023 and backdated, to remind me of a good time.

Yesterday, I went to a lovely party with some friends. As some of them were musicians, experienced radio DJs, and general enthusiasts, various people played DJ sets during the day and into the night...

I thought I'd swallow my fear and do a bit of my own. I expected to play for about 30 min and had broadly planned up until "Yes, I know" by Daphni.

At the 90 minute mark, after 18 vaguely nerve-wracking mixes, loops, and blends (and quite a lot of rum), I had to go find someone to take over as I was running out of ideas.

It remains one of the most fun things I've ever done, thanks mostly to the uncritical audience. While I didn't have the courage (or confidence in my setup) to record the set, I did manage to get dig out  the tracklisting, which is here:
