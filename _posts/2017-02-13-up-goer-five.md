This is a way to tell people what I do for a living, using only the ten hundred words that are used most often.

I think the idea is important, and fun. It came from [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1133/ "xkcd page about up goer five"). Thanks to [Randall Munroe](https://www.xkcd.com/about/ "xkcd about page") for it, and to the [Up-Goer Five Text Editor](http://splasho.com/upgoer5/).

## I write things that make computers work for people

I try to make those things fast, easy to use, hard to break, and easy to change without breaking.

I made a few things that lots of people all around the world use for fun, and some things that a smaller number of people use for work.

Sometimes I made the whole thing, but I usually help other people make it, or make just some parts.

I like to work out hard problems with computers, whether those problems are with understanding what people want, or making the computer do what I want in the best way.

I enjoy helping people understand computers better, especially people that already work with computers and want to learn more.
