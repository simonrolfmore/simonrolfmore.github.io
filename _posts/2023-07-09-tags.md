It turns out, just as I was ready to push the button on publishing this thing, that Jekyll doesn't generate tag pages for you.

It *almost* does - the amount of effort to create an "other pages with this tag" page is about 20 seconds, but it doesn't actually do it.

There are seemingly [some](https://github.com/pattex/jekyll-tagging) [plugins](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-archives), but none of them are [allow-listed by GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/versions/).

So, instead, I've had to create a `tag` folder, and fill it up manually with a series of short `<tag-name>.md` files. Like some sort of Neanderthal.

Ah well, the whole point of documenting more stuff is to learn.
