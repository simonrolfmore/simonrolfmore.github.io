That means, you can use anything posted here for any purpose you like, including commercial use. Just credit me.

If you use anything here for anything I deem evil or even merely unpleasant (including but not limited to racism, homophobia, transphobia, or cruelty in general), I *reserve the right to call you out*, make fun of you, not support you or your products, and generally assert my right to make moral decisions.
